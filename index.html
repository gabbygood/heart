        and girls. Five years later, in 1933, the school gave to the community its first twenty (20) graduates and responded to
        a growing felt need of High School Catholic Education in the city, the school operated with separate principals for the
        boys and for the girls. The girls division saw the birth of LOURDES ACADEMY which was managed by the Religious of the
